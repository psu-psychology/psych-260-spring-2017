## Keys for success

- Study the figures.
- Study regularly -- don't cram.
- Come to class.
- Participate!

## Why is biology essential for the science of behavior?

- What is science?
  - What distinguishes sciences?
  - What is neuroscience?
- Why is neuroscience harder than physics?
- Why is it more fun?

## What is science?

- [Science](http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/science)

## What is science?

- Body of facts or truths.
- Process of acquiring knowledge
  - Systematic study
  - Observation, experiment, description
  - Strives for objectivity
  - Aims at reliable, reproducible, general, systematic, universal laws
  
## Gilmore on science vs. religion

- Science is a way of thinking
- Science *describes*, but not well-suited to *proscribing*
- Science has little to say about what is good, just, right, moral, etc.
- Science rests on evidence and logic NOT on authorities
- Science respects tradition, but questions and tests it

## Gilmore on science vs. religion

- Science (and allied fields) is why human health and prosperity have advanced so significantly over the past 300 years.
- Science will be essential for maintaining and extending those advances in the future

## Similarities between sciences

- What are the different kinds of X?
    - Form, e.g., anatomy
- How does X work?
    - Function, e.g., physiology
- Where did X come from?
    - Origins, e.g., development/evolution
  
## What distinguishes sciences

- Phenomena of interest
- Methods or tools
- Levels of analysis
    - Spatial scale (nanometers to light-years)
    - Temporal scale (milliseconds to millenia)
    
## What is neuroscience?

- The study of the nervous system
    - And the behavior it makes possible
- Questions
    - What are the parts of the nervous system?
    - How do the parts work?  What do they do?
    - Where did they come from?

## A bit about systems

- What are systems?

## Related ideas

- Wikipedia on [systems theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systems_theory)
- Wikipedia on [systems thinking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systems_thinking)
- Wikipedia on [cybernetics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cybernetics)
    - *Science concerned with the study of systems of any nature which are capable of receiving, storing and processing information so as to use it for control.*

## Non-biological examples

- Solar system
- Climate system
- Economic system
- Internet

## Systems have

- Components
- Interactions
- Forces/influences
- Boundaries
- Inputs/outputs/processes

## Systems...

- "Behave" or change state across time
- Return to starting state
- Appear to be regulated, controlled, influenced by feedback loops

## May be thought of as [networks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_science)

## Why is studying systems so hard?

- Single parts -> multiple functions
- Single functions -> multiple parts
- Change structure/function over time (learning, development)
- Biological systems not "designed" like human-engineered ones
- What information is being processed? What is being controlled?
