### Academic Integrity

Penn State defines academic integrity as the pursuit of scholarly activity in an open, honest and responsible manner. All students should act with personal integrity, respect others dignity, rights and property, and help create and maintain an environment in which all can succeed through the fruits of their efforts (Faculty Senate Policy 49-20). Sanctions for academic misconduct can include a grade of F for the course as well as other penalties.

Students are responsible for maintaining academic integrity.  Violations include cheating on exams, talking to others during exams, looking at another student's test materials or answers during an exam, removing exams from the classroom without consent from the instructor, plagiarizing (do not copy from someone else!), and dishonesty in any aspect of course participation.

When you complete assignments, remember the **ABC**s to avoid plagiarism: **A**lways place copied information within quotation marks, include information about the quoted or paraphrased source in a **B**ibliography, and **C**ite the source in the body (in the text) of your paper immediately after the quoted or paraphrased information. When in doubt, cite in the text and include the source in a bibliography.

### Late, missed or make-up assignments

#### Exams

Make-up exams may be permitted under unusual circumstances such as (a) an interview for graduate school or a job, (b) illness, (c) religious observance, (d) the death of a family member, or (e) any other event recognized by the university as a valid excuse for absence from class.

If you must miss class on the day an exam is scheduled, you must do the following:

1. Contact the TA or the instructor by telephone, email, or in person in advance of the exam. Twenty-four hours notice is expected. If you do not contact the TA or instructor in advance, it is possible that you may not be able to schedule a make-up exam.
2. Arrange with the TA or instructor to take a make-up exam as soon as possible, but no later than one (1) week following the date of the scheduled exam. It is your responsibility, not the TA's or the instructor's to schedule an approved make-up exam in a timely way.

#### Quizzes

No make-up quizzes will be given except under unusual circumstances. You may ask for a copy of the quiz for studying purposes, however.

#### Accommodation for persons with disabilities

Penn State welcomes students with disabilities into the University's educational programs. Please refer to the information provided by Student Disability Resources (SDR) at <http://equity.psu.edu/student-disability-resources/> for information about the procedures required to obtain reasonable accommodations in this course. Students should discussSDR-approved accommodations with their instructor as early in the semester as possible, even if they have taken another course with the instructor. Please note: students are not required to provide their instructor with information about the nature of their condition.
 
Penn State students are also welcome to contact other units for assistance with personal concerns that interfere with academic progress, including: Counseling and Psychological Services (CAPS; <http://studentaffairs.psu.edu/counseling/>), the Office of Student Affairs (<http://studentaffairs.psu.edu/>), Career Services (<http://studentaffairs.psu.edu/career/>), the Center for Women Students (<http://studentaffairs.psu.edu/womenscenter/>), the LGBTQA Student Resource Center (<http://studentaffairs.psu.edu/lgbtqa/>), the Office of Sexual Misconduct
Prevention and Response (<http://titleix.psu.edu/>), Penn State Educational Equity (<http://equity.psu.edu/>), the Multicultural Resource Center (<http://equity.psu.edu/mrc>), and University 
Health Services (<http://studentaffairs.psu.edu/health/>).

### Nondiscrimination Statement

### Mandated Reporting Statement

Penn State's policies require me, as a faculty member, to share information about incidents of sex-based discrimination and harassment (discrimination, harassment, sexual harassment, sexual misconduct, dating violence, domestic violence, stalking, and retaliation) with Penn State's Title IX coordinator or deputy coordinators, regardless of whether the incidents are stated to me in person or shared by students as part of their coursework.
